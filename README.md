# python-code-101
My first python code for bioinformatics class.

This was the first assignment in my bioinformatics class (Population genetics). A text file was given with a set of 3 different sequences. We were supposed to find out SNPs. This course was taught by Prof Matt Hahn.

# Warning

The code is written in older python verion so it is not compatible with python3. Please adjust the code according to python3 synthex to be able to run it correctly.


# Credits

I would like to thank my friend Ms. Dhara Shah for helping me out to learn how to code throughout this class.
